Why is Java slow?
The two main reasons behind the slowness of Java are

Dynamic Linking: Unlike C, linking is done at run-time, every time the program is run in Java.
Run-time Interpreter: The conversion of byte code into native machine code is done at run-time in Java
which furthers slows down the speed
However, the latest version of Java has addressed the performance bottlenecks to a great extent.
