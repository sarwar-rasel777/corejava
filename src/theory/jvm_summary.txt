Full form of JVM is Java Virtual Machine. JVM in Java is the engine that drives the Java Code.
    It converts Java bytecode into machines language.
JVM architecture in Java contains classloader, memory area, execution engine etc.
In JVM, Java code is compiled to bytecode. This bytecode gets interpreted on different machines
JIT stands for Just-in-time compiler. JIT is the part of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    It is used to speed up the execution time
In comparison to other compiler machines, JVM in Java may be slow in execution.
